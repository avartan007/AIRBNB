### About "Keeping it Hidden" ⚠️
**Reality Check**: Commits cannot be hidden on GitHub - and that's actually GOOD:

**Why being visible helps:**
- Proves you did the real work
- Shows development consistency
- Demonstrates skill progression
- Impresses potential employers
- Industry-standard practice
- Completely ethical

**What was misunderstood:**
- Thought: Hidden commits would look better
- Reality: Visible commits look MUCH better
- Reason: Shows real work, not fake activity
